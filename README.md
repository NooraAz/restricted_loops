# Restricted Loops

Restricted loops are defined as loops in range of 4-40 residues, whose ends (CA-CA) are closer than 3.9 A.

This database is extracted from RCSB proteins. 3692 resloops were found in total.

*Notice: loops are not screened for their SASA.*

*Notice 2: loops sequences are not unique.*
